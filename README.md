# python-learning

### Simple python learning that UoP school of computing has taught me or my free time.

If you want to run the weekly scripts then you need to have [graphics.py](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) saved in your file-space where Python will be able to find it; this might be

  ### `C:\Python37\Lib\site-packages`
  
(or the Lib/site-packages subfolder of your chosen Python installation folder) if you're working on Windows, and

### `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages`

on a Mac. This is the [documentation](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf) that comes with that if you want to have a play around yourself.
